In my configuration I use a separate /31 PtP cidr block in the 10.150.0.x range, chose an appropriate IP range for what you would like all your
wireguard interfaces to use.

Steps for adding a new site2site

1) Add new Tunnel
        description: Name Site2Site wgX
        Generate Keys
        Note the public key and port
        Save tunnel & Apply

2) Look at System-> Routing to determine the next available /31 IP block and note that

3) Assign an interface
        dropdown select the new wg
        click the new "opt" interface name
        Check: Enable at the top
        convention: Sitename_Site2Site_wgX
        IPv4 Static IPv4
        MTU: 1420
        IPv4 Address: Next available /31 in 10.150.0.x (Even Number on PFSense Side, +1 for other side)
        Save & Apply

4) Back to System -> Routing
        Gateways
        Add
        Address Family IPv4
        Name: WG_VPN_sitename_V4
        Gateway: 10.150.0.(IP assigned to this FW side of the tunnel /31, even number)
        Monitor IP: Lan IP of remote peer firewall/router

        Static Route
        Add remote LAN netblocks to new gateway

5) Goto Firewall Rules
        add an ipv4 allow any/any for the new interface ruleset

6) Run Script
        ssh fw (or wherever you are running the script that has wireguard tools)
        wg_site_to_site_peer.sh
        Supply Public Key & Port from step 1
        Supply Remote PTP link IP from step 2

7) Goto the Tunnel config, open the tunnel with no peers, click to add a peer
        Dynamic unless you have dyndns or static IP for remote side
        public key from the wireguard command in #6 (contents of wg.pub)
        preshared key(contents of wg.psk)
        Allowed IPs,  add the subnets that exist on the remote site and the 10.150.0.x/31 point to point peer OR the 3 rfc1918 blocks

8) Remote side
