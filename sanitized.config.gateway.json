#
#this is an example config.gateway.json file for a usg3 that connects with wireguard to a pfsense headend vpn server to have lan access between them
#PFSense location has 172.22.0.0/16 network
#usg location has 10.33.14.0/24 network
#the PFSense wg tun interface is configured with 10.150.100.1/24
#the usg is another ip on this subnet(10.150.100.4/24 in my case)
#dynamic dns for usg setup using noip, reduce the max-interval so the account isn't suspended
#the unifi controller exists on the lan of the pfsense network, I want to use the unifi connection over the VPN,
# but I want it to use the public interface if the tunnel is down I need the dns to use my pfsense split resolution if its up
#and clear the dns cache if its not by restarting dnsmasq
#Don't nat traffic from the lans, I want them to behave like local lans to each other
#replace 1.0.0.1 and 1.1.1.1 with whatever dns servers you want if you dont want to use those
#the are quieried in reverse order from this file, which is why my pfsense dns is listed last, it will fail over to the others(when tun down)
#
#config starts below, remove this line and everything above
